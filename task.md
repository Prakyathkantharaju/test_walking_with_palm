## Comparing the agent with toes vs agent without toes

- [x] Setup regular env and viewer
- [ ] Setup RL agent to load the env and walk straight

- [ ] Setup Ray or stable-baselines3 for training the agent
  - [ ] Regular network
  - [ ] CNN network
  - [ ] attention network

- [ ] Launch the training in the cloud

- [ ] Write IK code for the legs moving for actual robot to move.

- [ ] Add COM to the robot as command. ( Still needs a lot more reading.)
  - [ ] Reward shaping for the input command
  - [ ] Demonstration learning and Human in the loop learning.
